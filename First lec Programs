# TYPE CASTING 

a = 10
b = 1.32
print(a+b)# we will get the required value 11.32

#but if we add a string into the floating value the error will occur because 
#string and float are not the same type so for avoiding that we add int("string")
# a = "2"
# b = 10.3 
# print(a+b)
# this will be error

a = int("2")
b = 10.32

# INPUT IN PYTHON 

name = input("enter you name :")
print("whatsupp", name)
#so this will take your input and then give you the output like
#whatsupp input that you have given 

# so basically all the input values types is string is given but if we have to change it
#we have to use type casting for example 

# name = input("my name is :")
# print("whatsupp",name)
# age = int(input ("my age is :"))
# print ("oo you are just ", age,"you are very younger")
# marks = float(input("my marks are :"))
# print("you got",marks,"Congratulations Boy")



# SOME QUESTIONS/ PROBLEMS 
#1. WRITE A PROGRAMM TO INPUT 2 NUMBERS AND PRINT THEIR SUM

first = int(input("first number:"))
second = int(input("second number:"))
print("Sum =",first + second)


#2. WRITE A PROGRAMM WHICH INPUT SIDE OF A SQUARE AND PRINT ITS AREA

side = int(input("first side :"))
print("the area is equal to the",side*side,"sq meter")

#3. wap to input 2 floating point numbers and print their average

first = float(input("first number is :"))
second = float(input("seconf number is :"))
print("the average of the two floating numbers is = ", (first+second)/2)

#4. wap to input two integer a and b , print ture if a>=b and if not then print False

a = int(input("first number is ="))
b = int(input("second number is ="))

print("the given statement is:",a>=b)
